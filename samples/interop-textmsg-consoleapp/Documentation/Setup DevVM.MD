Over the course of walk-through for this sample we will be performing various developer tasks including coding, compiling, configuring, and deploying IoT Edge module and IoT devices. To provide a common basis for the performing these tasks, we recommend the use of the [DevVM scripts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/IoTEdgeAndMlSample/blob/master/DevVM) in the [IoTEdgeandMLSample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/IoTEdgeAndMlSample) to create an configure an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) specifically for this walk-through.
