# Step 8: Deploy the Modules onto the IoT Edge Device
Having the IoT Edge device set up, we now deploy the Linux modules onto the device.

## Steps in the development VM

1. Perform the following steps from **Deploy Azure IoT Edge modules from Visual Studio Code** documentation.
    * [Sign in to access your IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-vscode#sign-in-to-access-your-iot-hub)  
    * [Deploy to your device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-vscode#deploy-to-your-device)  
    (Select the file **deployment.amd64.json** from the **config** folder as manifest file to be deployed.)
      
    * [View modules on your device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-vscode#view-modules-on-your-device) 

## Steps in the Linux environment of the IoT Edge Device
Using the Linux command shell that you signed into in [Step 6.2](./Configuring%20the%20IoT%20Edge%20Device.MD), run the following command to see the modules that have been deployed to your edge device.
```powershell
sudo iotedge list
```

You should see the CSharpModule like the following:
